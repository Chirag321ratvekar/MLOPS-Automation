# MLOPS AUTOMATION


### MLOPS = MACHINE LEARNING on DEVOPS


# Project on integration of Machine Learning  with Jenkins & Docker 

This project is based on the the automation of machine lerning model , when it'll be integrated with docker & jenkins. Bascially to create a machine learning model  is not a tough task as we've to run it  , or trained it & find the accuracy all these things we can find easily with the automation process. we have to only define the job in jenkins according to the our requirements & use cases.


# Feature of Project

  1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Python3 and Keras or numpy  installed  using dockerfile 

  2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts train the model in the container.

  3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3, job4 and job5 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

  4.  Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

  5.  Job2 : We've to the build the our **own docker image** according the our code ( that docker image has been created by me though the **Dockerfile** inside that we've to write the all the libraries required for that code ).

  6.  Job3 : We've to launch the container in docker according to our CNN code.

  7.  Job4 : We,ve to run the CNN code inside our docker & find the **Accuracy** of the model.

  8.  Job5 : We,ve to send the notification to the developer if accuracy of the model is more than 80%.


# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

firstly i write the python code for CNNN model in jupyter notebook & after that i download that code in to **.py extension**  & then copy this code into a seperate folder or directory inside the **RHEL8** operating system with the help of **Winscp software**. After that i upload this code on **GitHub** where i created a repository for the same & initialize this repository in githu


After that i launch my **RHEL8** operating systemtcreate the seperate **workspace** to work on this project & & create A docker file with command 
```
vim Dockerfile  

```
inside this file i used centos: latest version as my base image & install all the required libraries to run the CNN code .
